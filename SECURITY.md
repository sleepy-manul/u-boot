# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

As this is a fork of the main repository with the specific purpose of enabling the Firefly ITX-3588J board, please report any vulnerabilities to the upstream project ( https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot ). 

However, if you find a vulnerability specific to my branch or a KConfig setting I use, please contact me directly. 
Unless there are special circumstances like vacation, I will try and respond to any security-related inquiries within 24h.
